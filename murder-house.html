			  <h2 class="article_title">The details of the book</h2><br>
			  <p>
The book Murder House is written by the authors James Patterson and David Ellis. The famous thriller writer James Patterson was born on March 22, 1947. David Ellis (who writes usually with the famous author) was born on January 1, 1967. The book was first published on September 28, 2015 and it contains 480 pages.</p>

<h2 class="article_title">Complete summary of the book</h2><br>
The main character of the book is detective Jenna Murphy. She worked as a police officer in her uncle&rsquo;s department. Actually, she lived in New York, but after the jobs were hard to come by, she decided to come again to the place where she was born. So, her uncle (who was the local police chief) gave her the opportunity to work on his department. Her first case was the murder of a famous person from Hollywood (Zachary Stern) and his girlfriend (Melanie Phillips). Their dead body was found in the house at 7 Ocean Drive (also known as the murder house). Melanie had a former relation with a person named Noah Walker. She left him because of Zachary. The police arrested Noah, but because there wasn&rsquo;t sufficient evidence, they released him. When the uncle of Jenna gets into this case, he found several proofs that indicated the perpetrator, but after some days he was killed by someone else. Jenna was full of anger because of this incident. She was convinced that Noah killed all these people. So, the police arrested Noah again, but this time he was brought before the court. Noah was involved in several crimes (he was accused of shooting his classmate with a rifle when he was 11 years old) and also there were a lot of testimonies from several people who did accuse Noah for those crimes. This was the greatest mistake that Jenna made: she gave a false testimony to get Noah in the prison. She listened to her emotions, but didn&rsquo;t care about the truth. They found also a knife full of blood in the kitchen of Noah. he pleaded several times that he wasn&rsquo;t the perpetrator, but after all he was sentenced to prison by the judge. The truth arose after a year: Jenna gave a false testimony because of the false information given to her from her uncle. In reality her uncle planted the evidence (knife) into the kitchen of Noah, but because of her prejudge, she listens to her emotions and didn&rsquo;t look critical to the evidence which was given. Noah was free, but his girlfriend died when he was in the prison. So, this incident changed his whole life. After all they fell in love with Jenna, but Jenna was still thinking that he was involved of the murders. She didn&rsquo;t give up and looked dipper in to the case. On the past days there were several dead bodies found in the house at 7 Ocean Drive. Jenna and Aiden (her colleague) were in a risk full situation. The killer (Holden Dahluquist) knew they were looking for him. He made several phone calls wherein he called out the names of the people he wanted to kill. This time he called Jenna and said the names: Noah, Justin (her colleague), Aidan and Jenna. Eventually the plot took place on the way to her house: Holden thought Jenna was alone and tried to kill her, but when he attempted to shoot her, he realized that she wasn&rsquo;t alone. Noah was with her, so they tried to get him. This time Holden was shot by Noah (with the rifle of Jenna), but he wasn&rsquo;t dead. After that the judge sentenced Holden the whole life order. At the end Jenna reached her goal and the case was closed. After all those incidents the relation between Jenna and Noah improved. The hatred between the two turned into love. <br>
			  
<h2 class="article_title">Description of the most important characters</h2><br>
The most important characters of the book were Jenna Murphy and Noah Walker. Jenna Murphy, because she was the main character. She had a crucial role on the murders took place in the murder house. <br>
Noah Walker was the person who was falsely accused by Jenna. Eventually the bad relation between the two changed and they became lovers. <br>

<h2 class="article_title">Jenna Murphy</h2><br><br><p>
She is smart, but she can&rsquo;t use it properly. It&rsquo;s obvious that she has a great ego what causes her to be un= air (her emotions are for her more important). She is probably young and she wears a blue jacket over a white blouse, tight-fitting jeans and low heels. The most remarkable thing of her is that she has red hairs. <br>
Detective Jenna Murphy. Blue jacket over a white blouse, tight-fitting jeans, low heels.</p>

<p>She thinks she's smart. She thinks she's smarter than everyone, but she's not that smart. If she's so smart, why doesn't she remember me? From all those years ago. It might be fun to remind her one of these days.<br>
(Page 241-242)<br><br>
<h2 class="article_title">Noah Walker</h2><br>
Noah had psychosocial problems because what he had suffered when he was 11 years old. That incident made him look like the perpetrator.<br>
&quot;Are you kidding me? Because he's a psychopath, Murphy. The kind that could slaughter a family and then sit next to you on 3 bus and engage in polite conversation. He had no remorse, no guilt, no sense that he'd even done anything wrong,&quot;<br>
(Page 239)<br><br>
He has long dark hairs, he doesn&rsquo;t dress nice clothes, he has blue eyes (one of them is grayer) and he has an unshaven face. <br>
His eyes are still on me, his long dark hair hanging over his unshaven face.<br>
(Page 89)<br><br>
One of them: Noah Walker. T-shirt stretched tight over his chest, dirty jeans, work boots.<br>
(Page 244)<br><br>
His left eye looks odd because of the color, grayer than his other eye, which is solid blue.<br>

<h2 class="article_title">Technical Details</h2><br>
Murder House is a fiction book, but it&rsquo;s quite realistic and contains real aspects of the world we are living. It doesn&rsquo;t have an appointed time. It&rsquo;s rather a period of time wherein the events do happen. Likewise, the place is also not fixed. <br>
The times described in this book are: <br>
1. 1995, when a classmate of Noah Walker shot a kid before the school in Bridgehampton. Noah was falsely accused of it.<br>
2. 2007-08, when two twenty-years-olds disappeared. Their dead body was found near the beach close to the Murder House. <br>
3. 2011, when the ex-girlfriend of Noah (Melanie) and her boyfriend were killed by the killer. After that incident the uncle of Jenna was also killed. Noah was falsely one year imprisoned for it, but in reality, he didn&rsquo;t commit this crime. <br>
4. 2012, when the perpetrator was injured by Noah. After that the judge sentenced him to a whole life order, so Jenna Murphy reached her goal.<br>
The places described in this book are: <br>
1. The Murder House (at 7 Ocean Drive): it&rsquo;s perched up on the hill at Bridgehampton. The house has a view to the ocean and next to it is a beach. Inside the house sound echoes up to the impossibly high, rounded ceiling, decorated with an ornate fresco of winged angels, all of them appearing to reach toward something. One of the rooms is chilling and dated as the first. With patterned title floors and more of the arched, Old Testament ceilings, antique furniture, gold-framed portraits on the walls of men in ruffled shirts and long coats, wigs of wavy white hair. It was built by a guy named Winston Dahlquist. The dead body of several people were found in or near this house (near the beach). <br>
2. School of Noah Walker: there isn&rsquo;t enough information about the inside, but it is said that it&rsquo;s located in Bridgehampton.<br>
3. The courtroom: it&rsquo;s wall-to-wall with spectators and media, cops and prosecutors and people from the community. This was because of the several murders at the Murder House. Noah Walker and Holden were judged here. There isn&rsquo;t much information given about the inside.<br>
4. The prison: Noah was imprisoned in this place. The prison yard for A-block is a large swath of concrete and dead grass, plus a basketball court, all of surrounded by fence and razor wire.<br>
The book is narrated in two types:<br>
1. First person point of view. This type is only used by detective Jenna Murphy, Noah Walker and the killer Holden. This made the story more interesting, because you didn&rsquo;t really know who was narrating. Therefore, it was difficult to find out who the perpetrator was.<br>
2. The third person point of view (omniscient). This was mainly used to give detailed information about the characters, because if we know nothing about the characters, it would be a boring and undetailed book.<br>
Murder House is a thriller book. The authors are well-known with their work on thriller. What the name of the book indicates is obvious: a great number of people were cruelly murdered in this place; therefore, it was called the Murder House.</p>

<h2 class="article_title">Theme</h2><br><p>
The most important aspects of the book are collaboration, trust and love. The cops in the office must work together to find out who is the real perpetrator. Therefore, they have to collaborate in a manner that they can solve the cases. This reminds me of another book of James Patterson, Murder Games. Likewise, with the Murder House there is a serial killer who wants to kill Dr. Dylan Reinhart. To protect him detective Elizabeth Needham collaborates with the other cops. They get several death threats, but because of their teamwork they protect themselves. After all the Dealer (the serial killer) gave himself up. This shows how important teamwork is.<br>
The second important aspect is trust. Jenna Murphy trusted his uncle and did a bad act. This act (giving a false testimony) changed the whole story. If she didn&rsquo;t trust her uncle, she wouldn&rsquo;t falsely accuse Noah for the murders. This reminds me of the book A&uuml;slander. In that book it states that Piotr (a Polish orphan who was taken by a Nazi family) didn&rsquo;t trust the Nazis. He wasn&rsquo;t person who would betray his own nation. So, because of his national feelings he didn&rsquo;t trust the Nazis who give him the opportunity to became an advanced soldier. In fact, if he trusted him <br>
The third most important aspect is love. Jenna Murphy and Noah Walker did have a bad relation. Jenna accused him for the murder of her uncle. This caused her to hate him, but after knowing that he wasn&rsquo;t the one who killed her uncle, her feelings about him changes. Love took the place of hate. This reminds me of the book Valentine Joe. Valentine was a soldier from England. He fought against the Germans at the First World War. When he saw Rose, he loved her, but the other way around wasn&rsquo;t the same. She suffered much from the war. It caused her to lose her family. She was also nationalist, but after all those incidents Valentine made her go to her old self. This wasn&rsquo;t easy for her. Her country fought against England and Valentine was a soldier of England. So, it was a bit strange to love him, but her love to Valentine was beyond her nationalist feelings. Eventually her anger against him became slowly on the level of loving him. She never expected that she would love a man from England, but her feelings took her to this stage.</p>

<h2 class="article_title">Personal Opinion</h2><br><p>
The book is well written and has a good story. James Patterson and David Ellis wrote a super realistic thriller book. Because the narrator perspective changes it makes the story more thrilled. I think it was one of the best books that I have read from James Patterson. I already read some of the works of him, but in this book the story was more thrilled than his other works. I personally thought that the killer was one of the cops (Aidan), because when the story was narrated by the killer it gave a sense that the killer was close to the cops (that he was one of the colleagues of them). <br>
&quot;I saw the police report myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why wasn't Aiden arrested?&quot;<br>
(Page 305)<br><br>
Later it turned out that it was an old classmate of Jenna, Holden. I didn&rsquo;t expect that, but it was also a little bit suspicious that the killer knew so much about detective Jenna. <br>
She thinks she's smart. She thinks she's smarter than everyone, but she's not that smart. If she's so smart, why doesn't she remember me? From all those years ago. It might be fun to remind her one of these days.<br>
(Page 242)<br><br>
After all I found the book exiting and full of thriller. Normally I don&rsquo;t read thriller books. Instead of that I read books about war and history. So, I recommend everyone who loves thriller books to read it.<br>
Details about the authors<br>
The book is written by two famous writers: James Patterson and David Ellis. James Patterson was born on March 22, 1947. He is definitely one of the best thriller book writers.

His most famous works are: The Hidden Man, Breach of Trust and Murder House. <br>
